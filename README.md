# WebSearchEngine

A standalone web search engine with runtime search result clustering using Carrot. Used Suffix Tree, K-Means and Lingo for clustering.

For ranked results at queries the Bing API.

For indexing, it uses Apache Lucene.

For Clustering, it uses Carrot2.

I think this is the first project in GitHub that shows how to integrate Carrot2's API in your own application. The Carrot2 documentation 
was not particularly descriptive in this regard. The hacks I made might be useful if you want to built a custom app without using their 
GUI Workbench.

Credit goes to Carrot2 developers(please check their license file in the lib directory) for building and supporting an awesome library.

As far as this project is concerned, if you want to reuse/modify/distribute any component you have to add a credit to the project 
and the license.
